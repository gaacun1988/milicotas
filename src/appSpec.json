We aim to build trust by showcasing personalized care and a wide variety of products, ensuring pet owners feel confident and informed. The design will be clean, organized, and approachable, using a color palette inspired by the logo and the natural, comforting tones of pet care.\n\n**Execution Blueprint:**\n1. The Grid as a Foundation for Clarity: A flexible 12-column grid will be used to organize information logically, ensuring easy navigation through services, products, and contact details.\n2. Typography for Trust and Friendliness: A clear, readable sans-serif font for body text will convey professionalism, while a slightly more characterful font for headings will add warmth and approachability.\n3. Color Palette Harmony: A primary palette derived from the logo will be used to create a welcoming and trustworthy atmosphere, with accent colors for calls to action.\n4. Visual Storytelling: High-quality imagery of pets, staff, and the clinic environment will be integrated to build an emotional connection and highlight the personalized service and product variety.\n5. Component-Based Design: Standard UI components like cards, buttons, and forms will be styled consistently to ensure a cohesive and intuitive user experience.",

Text should almost exclusively use the 'foreground' color (or 'secondaryForeground' when on beige blocks) to ensure sharp legibility. The 'primary' color is an accent used sparingly but effectively for graphic anchors (like horizontal separator lines), active states, or key call-to-action links. Avoid using the 'primary' color for large background areas; keep it as a refined highlight.",

The Grid as a Foundation for Clarity: A flexible 12-column grid will be used to organize information logically, ensuring easy navigation through services, products, and contact details.\n2. Typography for Trust and Friendliness: A clear, readable sans-serif font for body text will convey professionalism, while a slightly more characterful font for headings will add warmth and approachability.\n3. Color Palette Harmony: A primary palette derived from the logo will be used to create a welcoming and trustworthy atmosphere, with accent colors for calls to action.\n4. Visual Storytelling: High-quality imagery of pets, staff, and the clinic environment will be integrated to build an emotional connection and highlight the personalized service and product variety.\n5. Component-Based Design: Standard UI components like cards, buttons, and forms will be styled consistently to ensure a cohesive and intuitive user experience.",

Secondary color (#FFC107) is for secondary calls to action or highlighting special offers. Custom colors are derived from the logo and can be used for decorative elements or specific sections to maintain brand consistency. Ensure high contrast for foreground elements.",

Ensure text on background colors maintains sufficient contrast. Avoid using logoAccent1 or logoAccent2 for critical information without sufficient contrast against the background."
